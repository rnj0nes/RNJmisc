# I asked ChatGPT:#     I have a text file called "ex01.out". In it is a block of text that #     I have reproduced below. The key words that identify the start of #     this block of text is "EIGENVALUES FOR SAMPLE CORRELATION MATRIX". #     The block ends with "EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS WITH 1 FACTOR". #     Inside those two key phrases are a series of numbers. One set of #     numbers are ordinal indicators (1,2,3,4,5,6) and the others are #     the actual eigenvalues. I would like to extract the eigenvalues #     into a vector. I would like to be able to do this in a function, #     so I can extract eigenvalues from other files (the values might#     be different). Here is the text block:##  I didn't even give the block to ChatGPT. It gave me most of this #  function that I only had to modify a little bit to get to work.# Example usage:# numbers <- c(1.000, 2.000, 3.000, 4.000, 5.000, 2.942, 0.997, 0.704, 0.502, 0.437, 6.000, 0.418, 1.000)# filtered_numbers <- removeIntegers(numbers)# print(filtered_numbers)extractEigenvalues <- function(filename) {   # Read the entire content of the file   lines <- readLines(filename)      # Find the start and end of the relevant block   start_index <- min(which(grepl("EIGENVALUES FOR SAMPLE CORRELATION MATRIX", lines)))   end_index <- min(which(grepl("EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS WITH 1 FACTOR", lines)))      # Extract the block of lines containing eigenvalues   eigen_block <- lines[start_index:end_index]      # Initialize a vector to hold the extracted eigenvalues   eigenvalues <- numeric()      # Loop through each line and extract numbers   for (line in eigen_block) {      # Use regular expressions to find numeric values      matches <- regmatches(line, gregexpr("[0-9]+\\.*[0-9]*", line))      # Append to the eigenvalues vector if numbers are found      if (length(matches[[1]]) > 0) {         eigenvalues <- c(eigenvalues, as.numeric(matches[[1]]))      }   }      # Return the eigenvalues   return(removeIntegers(eigenvalues))}# Example usage:# eigenvalues <- extractEigenvalues("path_to_your_file/ex01.out")# print(eigenvalues)# extractEigenvalues("EX01/ex01random.out")# print(eigenvalues)removeIntegers <- function(numbers) {   # Convert the character vector to numeric if it isn't already   if (is.character(numbers)) {      numbers <- as.numeric(numbers)   }      # Create a logical vector to identify non-integers   non_integers <- (numbers != floor(numbers)) | (floor(numbers) != numbers - 0.000)      # Return the vector without the integers   return(numbers[non_integers])}
